I could roll you to hell
I could swim from your heavens
I could drive you so safe
I could walk you to here
Let us float in the tears
Let us cry from the laughters
When it's not for some sake
And the city's not near

Well now, you're going back
You're going back, you're going back

But I hope you could hear
All the screams from the forest
All the ghosts in the trees
And the love of a dog
Let us float in the tears
Let us cry from the laughters
When it's not for some sake
And the city's not near

Well now, you're going back
You're going back, you're going back

You said, "Driver, please, don't go that fucking way"
You said, "Just let it go away"
You said, "Just let it go"

I could roll you to hell
I could swim from your heavens
I could drive you so safe
I could walk you to here
But you dry me to tears
Like I cry from your laughters
When it's not for some sake
And the city's still dear

And now, you're going back
You're going back, you're going back

Oh, now you're going back
